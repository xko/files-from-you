CPU usage reporting and analysis demo
-----------------------------

_Future of the Files-FU - a revolutionary file sharing serive - is in danger, as their client app seems to consume too much CPU, making the service unusable.._

This is a proof-of-concept demo, addressing some aspects of the [home assignment](Hive_Streaming_Backend_Home_Assignment.pdf) for the interview with [Hive Streaming](https://www.hivestreaming.com/)


### Implementation overview 

The task is very open-ended, and the assgnment allows much room for the interpretation. A lot of work where therefore put into extracting the requriements, 
coming up with reasonable assumptions, making implementation choices etc - this is all documented in the [tickets](../../issues/). 
Most important are collected on [Overview board](../../projects/5), 
which aims to provide good coverage of the features requested by the assignment and the questions it opens for discussion - both implemented and omitted in this demo.
